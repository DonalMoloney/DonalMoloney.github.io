## Overview

In the quest to conquer the LeetCode Word Search II problem, I ventured into three distinct territories: Backtracking with Trie, DFS with Trie, and DFS with Set. The Backtracking approach intricately intertwined Trie structures to swiftly eliminate invalid paths, effectively streamlining the search process. The second approach, DFS with Trie, embarked on a journey of optimized depth-first exploration, capitalizing on Trie's efficiency to match potential words. The third approach, DFS with Set, aimed at reducing redundancy through a carefully curated Set data structure. Through meticulous performance assessment, each approach revealed its own prowess in tackling the problem's intricacies, providing a comprehensive overview of their unique strengths and efficiencies.
