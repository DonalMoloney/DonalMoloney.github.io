## Overview

The "Sudoku Solver" project ingeniously employs backtracking, alongside an interactive Sudoku grid and intuitive graphical interface, all built using the pygame library. It not only offers players puzzle-solving and puzzle-generation features but also leverages the powerful backtracking algorithm for solving Sudoku puzzles. Key features include interactive Sudoku grid, temporary number input, time tracking, dynamic difficulty selection, auto-solving with the SPACE key, and helpful instructions via a help button. Essential classes and functions include Cube and Grid, along with utility functions like find_empty, valid, redraw_window, and format_time. To play, launch the game, interact with the Sudoku grid, and witness the backtracking algorithm in action as it conquers Sudoku challenges.
