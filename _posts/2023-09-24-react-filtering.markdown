## Overview

Frontend Assessment - Student Profiles Overview

This assessment involves building a frontend application that interacts with a public JSON API to display student profiles. It comprises several key parts:

Data Fetching and Styling: In the initial phases, you'll fetch student data from the API and style the web page to match a provided design, ensuring font consistency and proper scrolling behavior.

Filtering, Expansion, and Tagging: The subsequent parts involve adding functionality for users to filter students by name, create expandable student lists to display test scores, and add tags to students. Additionally, you'll implement tag-based filtering and create a seamless user experience for searching and managing student profiles.

Your submission will be assessed for correctness, code organization, readability, maintainability, code performance, and adherence to best practices. Once complete, push your changes to the GitHub repository and mark the assessment as done on the Hatchways dashboard for review.
